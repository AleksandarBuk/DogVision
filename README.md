# Dog Breed Classifier

This is a dog breed classifier neural networks model that was developed using the dataset from the Kaggle competition [Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification).

## Overview

I created this model as a late submission to test its accuracy in identifying dog breeds. The project utilizes various tools and technologies to build a neural network for dog breed classification.

## Tools Used

The following tools and libraries were used in the development of this model:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- TensorFlow Hub
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Flask (for deploying the model)
- Google Cloud (for model training)

## Google Colab

The initial development and training of this model were done on Google Colab. You can find the Colab notebook in the repository, which details the model's architecture and training process.
